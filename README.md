# Python_wk8 - PROJECT

# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

## Project Description

This project is a data analysis and reporting tool that tracks global COVID-19 trends. It analyzes cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations across countries and time. The project involves cleaning and processing real-world data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), generating insights, and visualizing trends using Python data tools.  The final output is an interactive report, suitable for presentation or publishing.

## Objectives

* Import and clean COVID-19 global data
* Analyze time trends (cases, deaths, vaccinations)
* Compare metrics across countries/regions
* Visualize trends with charts and maps
* Communicate findings in a Jupyter Notebook

## Tools and Libraries Used

* Python
* pandas
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* ipywidgets
* Jupyter Notebook
* plotly (optional, for choropleth map)

## How to Run/View the Project

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    * Install Python (3.7 or later is recommended).
    * Install the required Python libraries.  You can install them using pip:
        ```bash
        pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn ipywidgets
        pip install plotly  # If you want to use the choropleth map
        ```
    * Download the COVID-19 data from Our World in Data: [https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv](https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv) and save it in the same directory as the notebook.

2.  **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
    * Open the Jupyter Notebook (e.g., using Anaconda Navigator, or by typing `jupyter notebook` in your terminal).
    * Navigate to the directory where you saved the notebook and the `owid-covid-data.csv` file.
    * Open the notebook (e.g., `covid_19_tracker.ipynb`).
    * Run the cells in the notebook.  The notebook will:
        * Load the data.
        * Clean the data.
        * Perform the analysis.
        * Generate the visualizations.
        * Display the results.
        * The notebook is interactive.  Use the dropdowns and date pickers to select the country and date range you want to analyze. The plots will update automatically.

3.  **View the Results:**
    * The output of the analysis, including the visualizations and narrative explanations, will be displayed within the Jupyter Notebook.
    * You can export the notebook to other formats (e.g., PDF, HTML) using the "File" -> "Download as" menu in Jupyter Notebook.

## Insights and Reflections

This project provides a framework for analyzing COVID-19 data and generating insights.  Here are some potential insights and reflections:

* The pandemic has had different trajectories in different countries, highlighting the impact of various public health interventions and socioeconomic factors.
* Vaccination campaigns have played a crucial role in mitigating the spread of the virus and reducing mortality.
* Data visualization is essential for communicating complex information effectively and informing public health decision-making.
* This project can be extended to include other relevant data, such as hospitalization rates, ICU occupancy, and mobility data, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the pandemic.
